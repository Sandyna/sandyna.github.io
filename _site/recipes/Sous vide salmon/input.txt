2 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon filets
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 cups ice water
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 cup creme fraiche, sour cream, or full-fat Greek yogurt 
1/4 cup loosely packed chopped fresh dill, chives, or tarragon
Zest and juice of 1 lemon
1 English cucumber, sliced in 1/4-inch rounds
1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar

Set the Anova Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 125ºF (52ºC) for medium-rare or 135ºF (57ºC) for medium.
For the brine, whisk 1/4 cup kosher salt into the ice water until dissolved. Add the salmon and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to one hour.
Remove the salmon fillets from the brine and rinse with cold water. Pat dry and place each filet in a separate zipper lock or vacuum seal bag with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Seal the bags using the water immersion technique or a vacuum sealer on the moist setting. Place in the water bath and set the timer for 20 minutes, or up to 50 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the lemon-dill creme fraiche: In a medium bowl, stir together the creme fraiche, dill, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Prepare the cucumber salad: In a second medium bowl, combine the cucumber, red onion, red wine vinegar, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Finishing steps:
When the timer goes off, remove the bags from the water bath. Carefully remove the salmon and pat very dry with paper towels.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the salmon skin-side down and sear until skin is crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Serve with lemon-dill creme fraiche and cucumber salad.
