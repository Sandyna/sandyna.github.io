1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, from 4-7 lemons
1 small bunch mint
2 cups water
1 cup light rum
3/4 cup lavender simple syrup (recipe below)
Lavender Simple Syrup:
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup water
1/4 cup dried lavender

In a pitcher, muddle mint leaves with lemon juice until well combined. Add water, rum, and 3/4 cup chilled lavender simple syrup. Stir.
Pour drink into ice-filled glasses.
Lavender Simple Syrup:
Put sugar, water, and dried lavender in a medium saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil.
Once mixture comes to a boil, lower to a simmer and let simmer for about 10 minutes, until it thickens.
Turn off the heat, cover the saucepan, and let steep for about an hour.
Push syrup through a mesh sieve to strain out lavender buds and into an airtight container. Place in fridge to cool.
