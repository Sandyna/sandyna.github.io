## Ingredients
* 4 large egg whites room temperature
* 1 pinch of salt
* 1 cup granulated sugar 200g
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or other flavouring

## Instructions
Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy. Increase speed to high.<br/>
With mixer on high, gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition).<br/>
Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume. Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved (you can test this by rubbing a small bit of the mixture between your fingers, if it feels gritty,  the sugar isn't dissolved).<br/>
AVOID ANY MOISTURE, GREASE OR YOLK in your mixture.<br/>
Stir in vanilla extract and any other extract you may like to use.  If using food coloring, add the food coloring at this stage, too.<br/>
Pipe onto a baking sheet/baking tray.<br/>
Bake at 100C with hot air program or 110C with top and bottom heating. Bake for 1-2 hours, take one out and if it gets crispy after cooling down, they are ready. No chewy center.<br/>
Store in airtight containers.<br/>
Different flavours:<br/>
Use vanilla sugar or lavender sugar or other herbal sugar for a twist. Blend it to make it finer.<br/>
