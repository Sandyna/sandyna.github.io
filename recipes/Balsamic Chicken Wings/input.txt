1 pound chicken wings 
2 cloves garlic minced finely 
2 Tbsp. Gluten Free soy sauce or Tamari or coconut aminos 
¼ cup balsamic vinegar 
2 tablespoons honey 
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger

In a bowl mix together vinegar, garlic, ginger, honey and gluten free soy sauce. Rinse and dry chicken wings, place in a plastic zip bag.  Pour sauce over wings making sure to coat them all over and seal the bag place and in the refrigerator for at least one hour. I prefer 4 hours for more flavor.
Remove the chicken wings from the bag and place on a foil lined cookie sheet. Bake 375˚ for 30 minutes. 
Serving Suggestions: For variety add 1 teaspoon red chili flakes for heat. Brush marinade over wings after 15 minutes of cooking for a more intense flavor.
