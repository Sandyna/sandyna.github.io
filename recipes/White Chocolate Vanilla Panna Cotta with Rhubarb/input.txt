1 can Full-fat Coconut Milk
4 tablespoons Maple Syrup (or agave syrup)
2 tablespoons Cacao butter, finely chopped
½ Vanilla Bean, sliced in half, seeds scraped
1 teaspoon Agar Agar, powdered
3 Rhubarb Stalks
½ cup Raw Cane Sugar
¼ cup Reisling Wine (water can also be used)

Place the coconut milk, maple syrup, cacao butter, vanilla bean and agar agar in a small saucepan. Heat on medium high, whisking occasionally, until the cacao butter is melted and agar agar is full dissolved. Bring just to a boil and remove from heat. Remove the vanilla bean and divide the mixture between 4-6 small jars or molds. Place in the fridge and chill for 2-3 hours.
Peel the rhubarb into thick ribbons with a potato peeler and place in a saucepan with the sugar and wine. Bring to a boil, stirring gently to dissolve the sugar. Boil for about 30 seconds and remove from heat.
Remove the strips of rhubarb from the syrup and let cool.
When rhubarb is cool, loosely coil the strips around your finger, using about 3-4 strips, until you form a rosette.
Place the rosette on top of a jar of panna cotta (or an unmolded panna cotta). Repeat with the remaining strips until all panna cottas are topped with rosettes. Drizzle the syrup on top of the panna cottas.
Serve cold.
