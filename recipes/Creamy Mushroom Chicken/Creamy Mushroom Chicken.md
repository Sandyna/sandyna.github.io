## Ingredients
* 2 large chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise
* Flour for dredging
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter divided
* 340g mushrooms (I used baby bellas) sliced
* 1 dash Italian seasoning
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1 cup heavy/whipping cream
* Salt & pepper to taste

## Instructions
Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthwise to make four thinner cutlets. Coat them in flour.<br/>
Add the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat.<br/>
Once the pan's hot, add the chicken. Cook it for 4-5 minutes/side until golden. Once this step is done, take the chicken out of the pan and set it aside.<br/>
Chop the mushrooms while cooking the chicken.<br/>
Add the remaining butter to the pan. Let it melt, then add the mushrooms and Italian seasoning.<br/>
Once the mushrooms start to release water, add the garlic to the pan. Continue cooking the mushrooms until all the water is cooked off.<br/>
Take the mushrooms out of the pan (ok to put them on the same plate as the chicken).<br/>
Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard to the pan. Give it a good stir until the mustard dissolves, and let it reduce for 3-4 minutes.<br/>
Add the cream to the pan, along with the chicken and mushrooms. Let the chicken cook for another 5 minutes or so until it's cooked through and the sauce has thickened a bit. Season with salt & pepper as needed.<br/>
