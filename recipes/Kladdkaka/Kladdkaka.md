## Ingredients
* 200g Caster Sugar
* 140g Plain Flour
* 50g Cocoa Powder
* 2tsps Baking Powder
* 2tsps Vanilla Sugar
* 120g Butter
* 2 eggs

## Instructions
Start off by preheating your oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Blend the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and vanilla sugar in a bowl. Melt the butter in a pan or the microwave and pour in. Mix well and finally crack in the eggs and beat together to form a thick batter.<br/>
Grease a round 20cm tin (a pie form?). If the tin has a tendency to stick, consider lining the bottom with greaseproof paper as well. Spoon the batter into the tin and smooth out to the edges.<br/>
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes before removing and allowing to cool for ~10 minutes before carefully removing from the tin. Try not to over-bake the cake. If you do the gooey consistency of the cake may be lost.<br/>
Enjoy with some raspberries and whipped cream, or just on its own, for a soft, chocolatey treat.<br/>
