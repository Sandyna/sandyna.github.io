## Ingredients
* 3 eggs whites, room temperature
* ¼ cup sugar
* 1¼ cups powdered sugar
* ¾ cup superfine almond flour
* ¼ cup crushed chocolate cookies
* 2 tablespoons dark cocoa powder
* ½ teaspoons black food coloring
* 2 cups of powdered sugar
* 1 cup of softened butter
* 1 teaspoons of vanilla
* 2 tablespoons of milk
* ½ cup cookies and cream filling

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 285ºF/140ºC.<br/>
2. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy.<br/>
3. Keep beating and slowly add sugar until stiff peaks form.<br/>
4. Sift powdered sugar, cookie crumbs, almond flour, and cocoa powder over the egg whites.<br/>
5. Fold the dry mixture into the egg whites completely, but make sure to not overmix or the macarons will not rise.<br/>
6. Once the batter reaches a lava-like consistency, add the food coloring. Mix until just combined, without over mixing.<br/>
8. Place the mixture into a piping bag or zip-top bag. Cut of the tip to pipe.<br/>
9. Pipe 1½-inch dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tip: take a little batter to “glue” down the edges of the parchment paper so it stays put.<br/>
10. Let the cookies rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour, until they are no longer wet to the touch and a skin forms on top.<br/>
11. While resting, make the filling by mixing the butter, powdered sugar, cookie cream filling, vanilla, and milk in a bowl until smooth. Transfer to a piping bag and set aside until ready to fill.<br/>
12. When the cookies are dry to the touch, bake for 15-18 minutes until they have risen.<br/>
13. Let rest for 10 minutes before filling. To fill, pipe about about a tablespoon of the buttercream onto one macaron and place another on top.<br/>
14. Macarons are best kept refrigerated until serving.<br/>
