1½ cups All purpose Flour
1 cup Raw Cane Sugar
2 teaspoons Baking Powder
½ teaspoon Salt
3 Eggs
1½ cups Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese
1 teaspoon Vanilla
½ teaspoon Almond Extract
4 ounces (8 tablespoons) Butter, melted
1 cup Raspberries, fresh or frozen
Powdered sugar, to top

Grease and flour a 10" round baking dish(make sure sides are high).
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, ricotta, vanilla, almond extract, and butter.
Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined and smooth.
Pour the batter into the prepared dish and smooth on top.
Sprinkle the raspberries evenly across the top of the batter.
Bake in the preheated oven for 50-55 minutes, or until golden, puffed, and firm on top.
Remove and let cool to room temperature.
Dust with powdered sugar and slice.
Vanilla Ice cream or a dollop of sweetened mascarpone would be nice on the side!
