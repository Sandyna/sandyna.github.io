4 large egg whites room temperature
1 pinch of salt
1 cup granulated sugar 200g
1 teaspoon vanilla extract or other flavouring

Using an electric mixer or a stand mixer (with either the whisk or paddle attachment), stir on low speed until mixture becomes foamy. Increase speed to high. 
With mixer on high, gradually add sugar, about 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition until sugar is dissolved (about 15-20 seconds between each addition). 
Beat until mixture is thick, shiny, and has increased in volume. Mixture should have stiff peaks and sugar should be completely dissolved (you can test this by rubbing a small bit of the mixture between your fingers, if it feels gritty,  the sugar isn't dissolved). 
AVOID ANY MOISTURE, GREASE OR YOLK in your mixture. 
Stir in vanilla extract and any other extract you may like to use.  If using food coloring, add the food coloring at this stage, too. 
Pipe onto a baking sheet/baking tray. 
Bake at 100C with hot air program or 110C with top and bottom heating. Bake for 1-2 hours, take one out and if it gets crispy after cooling down, they are ready. No chewy center. 
Store in airtight containers. 
Different flavours: 
Use vanilla sugar or lavender sugar or other herbal sugar for a twist. Blend it to make it finer.
