## Ingredients
* 2 tsp dried lavender
* 340.19 g salted butter at room temperature (add 1/4 teaspoon of salt per 1/2 cup (1/4 lb; 115g; 1 stick) of butter.)
* 200 g sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 496.12 g by weight all purpose flour (3.5 cups measured)

## Instructions
Grind the lavender up very finely using a mortar and pestle, until it is almost a powder.<br/>
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter, sugar, and lavender powder until combined and spread around the bowl.<br/>
Add the vanilla and mix just until it disappears. You can use a hand mixer as well, but you’ll need to do more kneading and shaping at the end. The stand mixer will beat it into a cohesive dough that can be rolled, but a hand mixer will not. It just kind of “tosses” it about as crumbs, so you'll need to shape it more by hand at the end before rolling.<br/>
Add flour to the bowl, and mix together until a dough ball forms.<br/>
Roll the dough out on a baking mat about 1/2" thick, then cut desired shapes. Squares, rectangles, and circles all work well.<br/>
Place the cookies on a sheet tray, and refrigerate for 1 hour, until cold and firm to the touch.<br/>
Preheat oven to 350F.<br/>
Bake the cookies for 20-25 minutes, until the cookies are lightly golden brown on the edges.<br/>
Let the cookies cool to room temperature, and enjoy!<br/>
