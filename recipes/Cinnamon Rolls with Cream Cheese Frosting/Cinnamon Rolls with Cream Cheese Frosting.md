## Ingredients

### Für den Teig
* 200 ml Milch
* 50 g Butter
* 450 g Mehl, bei Bedarf evtl. etwas mehr
* ½ TL Salz
* 70 g Zucker
* 1 Ei(er)
* 1 Pck. Hefe

### Für die Füllung
* 50 g Butter, weich
* 130 g Zucker, braun
* 2 TL Zimt

### Für die Glasur
* 100 g Frischkäse (Mascarpone, philadelphia...)
* 30 g Butter
* 100 g Puderzucker, gesiebt
* 4 Tropfen Vanillearoma

## Instructions
Teig und Füllung:<br/>
Briefly heat the milk and butter until the butter has melted. First, put 450 g of flour, salt, sugar and egg in a bowl. Make a well in the flour and crumble the yeast into it. Pour the me in and knead everything from the hollow outwards to a smooth dough. If the dough is still too sticky, gradually add just enough flour to make it work well. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour.<br/>
Roll out the dough into a rectangle and brush with the butter. Mix sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on top, leaving no border. Roll up from the long side and cut into 2 - 3 cm thick slices. Place cut side down in a greased baking dish (such as a casserole dish) and let rise, covered, for another 30 minutes.<br/>
Glasur:<br/>
Mix all the ingredients for the glaze. If it seems a little too thick, add a little milk - but it should definitely not be too runny. Of course, you can make a regular glaze of milk and powdered sugar if you like, but this one gives the recipe a special kick.<br/>
Finish:<br/>
Bake the rolls in a preheated oven at 180 °C top/bottom heat for about 15 - 20 min. Spread the glaze on the warm rolls and serve.<br/>
Personally, they taste best still warm, but you can also eat them cold.<br/>
