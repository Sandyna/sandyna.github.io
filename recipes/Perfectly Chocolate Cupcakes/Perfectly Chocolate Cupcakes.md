## Ingredients

### Cupcakes
* 400g sugar
* 225g cups all purpose flour
* 75g unsweetened cocoa (best quality available)
* 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
* 1.5 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs
* 240ml whole milk
* 120ml vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract (best quality available)
* 240ml boiling water

### Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting
* 113g unsalted butter (set at room temp about 10 minutes, but should still be cool)
* 225g cream cheese (directly from fridge)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (always use pure vanilla extract if possible)
* 450g powdered confectioners sugar
* 1 to 4 Tablespoons heavy cream, heavy whipping cream (or milk- although I do like the richness that cream adds)

## Instructions
Cupcakes:<br/>
Line muffin tin with paper liners.  Heat oven to 175 C.<br/>
In a large mixing bowl, stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.<br/>
Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla.  Beat on medium speed for one minute.<br/>
Stir in boiling water (the batter will be thin, don’t worry, this is right).<br/>
Fill liners 2/3 full with batter.  (I usually put the batter into a large measuring cup with a pour spout, and then pour the batter into the liners.)<br/>
Bake cupcakes for aproximately 18-22 minutes.<br/>
Cool completely on wire rack before frosting.<br/>
Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting:<br/>
Place butter in a large mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Add cream cheese and blend until fully combined and smooth, about 30 seconds.<br/>
Add vanilla extract and powdered sugar and blend on low speed until combined. Increase to medium speed and beat until it begins to get fluffy.<br/>
Slowly add the heavy cream, a little bit at a time until desired consistency is met. (Don’t add too much if you want the frosting to stay in place when piped on cupcakes.)<br/>
Beat until fluffy, about 1 minute.<br/>
Use at once or keep refrigerated. (This frosting will keep well in the refrigerator for several days, but you may need to re-beat it for the best texture.)<br/>
Note: I would use half of this or make twice as many cupcakes, because there is always some frosting left.<br/>
