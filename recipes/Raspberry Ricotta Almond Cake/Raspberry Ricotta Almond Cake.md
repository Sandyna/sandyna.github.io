## Ingredients
* 1½ cups All purpose Flour
* 1 cup Raw Cane Sugar
* 2 teaspoons Baking Powder
* ½ teaspoon Salt
* 3 Eggs
* 1½ cups Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese
* 1 teaspoon Vanilla
* ½ teaspoon Almond Extract
* 4 ounces (8 tablespoons) Butter, melted
* 1 cup Raspberries, fresh or frozen
* Powdered sugar, to top

## Instructions
Grease and flour a 10" round baking dish(make sure sides are high).<br/>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br/>
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.<br/>
In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, ricotta, vanilla, almond extract, and butter.<br/>
Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined and smooth.<br/>
Pour the batter into the prepared dish and smooth on top.<br/>
Sprinkle the raspberries evenly across the top of the batter.<br/>
Bake in the preheated oven for 50-55 minutes, or until golden, puffed, and firm on top.<br/>
Remove and let cool to room temperature.<br/>
Dust with powdered sugar and slice.<br/>
Vanilla Ice cream or a dollop of sweetened mascarpone would be nice on the side!<br/>
