## Ingredients

### For the blueberry jelly
* 1 cup wild blueberries
* 2 Tbsp + 1 cup water
* ⅓cup castor sugar
* 1 Tbsp lemon juice
* 1 sheet gelatin

### For the Lavender Jelly
* 1 Tbsp edible, dried lavender petals
* 2 cups boiling water
* ⅓ cup castor sugar
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 2 sheets gelatin

## Instructions
Put berries and 2 Tbsp water into a small saucepan and bring to boil. Cook until berries soften and juices run. Add 1 cup water, sugar and lemon juice.<br/>
Bring back to a medium rolling boil and cook until liquid has reduced by about half. Remove from heat.<br/>
Soak 1 gelatin leaf in cold water for a couple minutes, until soft. Squeeze off excess water and add to berry mixture, stirring well.<br/>
Divide between 6 cups and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.<br/>
Meanwhile, put lavender and water in a small saucepan and heat gently. Leave to infuse for about 10 minutes. Strain. Retain water in the saucepan. (at this point I used the spoon from the blueberry jelly to stir the Lavender in order to give it a bit of extra colour)<br/>
Heat lavender water (do not boil), add sugar and lemon juice and stir to dissolve. Soak 2 gelatin sheets in cold water for a couple of minutes and add to hot Lavender water, stirring well.<br/>
let lavender cool to room temperature.<br/>
Remove blueberry jelly from fridge and add equal amounts of lavender jelly to each cup. Return to fridge to set, about 1 hour.<br/>
