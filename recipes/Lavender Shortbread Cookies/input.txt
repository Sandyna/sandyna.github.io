2 tsp dried lavender
340.19 g salted butter at room temperature (add 1/4 teaspoon of salt per 1/2 cup (1/4 lb; 115g; 1 stick) of butter.)
200 g sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
496.12 g by weight all purpose flour (3.5 cups measured)

Grind the lavender up very finely using a mortar and pestle, until it is almost a powder.
In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the butter, sugar, and lavender powder until combined and spread around the bowl.
Add the vanilla and mix just until it disappears. You can use a hand mixer as well, but you’ll need to do more kneading and shaping at the end. The stand mixer will beat it into a cohesive dough that can be rolled, but a hand mixer will not. It just kind of “tosses” it about as crumbs, so you'll need to shape it more by hand at the end before rolling.
Add flour to the bowl, and mix together until a dough ball forms.
Roll the dough out on a baking mat about 1/2" thick, then cut desired shapes. Squares, rectangles, and circles all work well. 
Place the cookies on a sheet tray, and refrigerate for 1 hour, until cold and firm to the touch.
Preheat oven to 350F.
Bake the cookies for 20-25 minutes, until the cookies are lightly golden brown on the edges.
Let the cookies cool to room temperature, and enjoy!
