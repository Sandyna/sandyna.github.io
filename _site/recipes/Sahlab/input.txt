4 cups milk
1 tablespoon sahlab (or cornstarch, use 4 tablespoons)
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon rose water or 1 teaspoon of vanilla
Ground cinnamon or chopped pistachios on top

Place the milk in a saucepan and add the sahlab previously mixed with sugar. Stir and bring to a simmer, and keep stirring until thickened. Add the rose water and stir to mix. Transfer to cups and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve with crackers or kaak.
Note: 
If the quantity of sahlab is not sufficient to thicken the mixture, add more, 1/2 tablespoon or up to one tablespoon. If unable to source the sahlab, substitute cornstarch and double the quantity (4 to 6 tablespoons cornstarch)
