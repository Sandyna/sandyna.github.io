Lavender Simple Syrup:<br/>
Put sugar, water, and dried lavender in a medium saucepan, stir, and bring to a boil.<br/>
Once mixture comes to a boil, lower to a simmer and let simmer for about 10 minutes, until it thickens.<br/>
Turn off the heat, cover the saucepan, and let steep for about an hour.<br/>
Push syrup through a mesh sieve to strain out lavender buds and into an airtight container. Place in fridge to cool.<br/>
