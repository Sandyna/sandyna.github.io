Here's some cookie ideas: mint and chocolate chips. Strawberry and white chocolate chips. Grind dried lavender with sugar in a pestle, sift and replace part of the sugar for lavender cookies. Orange peel, cardamom, spices, dark chocolate chips. Rainbow sprinkles. Go crazy. We all know you need it. You wouldn't be here, baking cookies at 3am otherwise.<br/>
