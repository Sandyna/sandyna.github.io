255 g white chocolate-chopped into very small pieces
70 g unsalted butter-softened
3 Tablespoons heavy cream (45 ml)
35 g freeze dried blueberries- powdered (pulse FREEZE DRIED blueberries in a food processor or coffee grinder to make the powder)
30 g powdered sugar

In a small sauce pan simmer heavy cream. Remove from heat, add softened butter and stir until butter is completely melted and combined with heavy cream. Add powdered dried blueberries and stir to combine. Set aside.
Over a double boiler melt chopped white chocolate, stirring casually until smooth and completely melted. DO NOT heat above 105 F (if touched with your finger, it will feel about the same temperature as your body).
Gently stir in lukewarm blueberry mixture into melted chocolate. It should be approximately the same temperature as melted chocolate when you combine them.
Cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm enough to roll the balls (2-3 hours or overnight). While it’s cooling take it from the fridge and stir with a fork to prevent the fat separate on top. Cover with plastic wrap and place back into the fridge.
Scoop out the mixture and roll into 1 inch balls. Clean your hands with paper towel after each truffle if the mixture stick too much or you can dust your hands with powdered sugar.
Roll each truffle into powdered sugar to coat them well. Store in the fridge in airtight container up to 1 week or freeze for longer storage
Tips:
Use high quality white chocolate. Do not use almond bark or chocolate chips.
Chop the chocolate into really small pieces it will help to melt easier.
White chocolate has to be melted at very low temperature . Lower temperature means more time to melt so you need to be very patience while melting the chocolate. If you overheat it, the chocolate could separate or size and became unusable. You must melt it at 105 F at most and that means you can just about touch it with your fingers and not burn your finger.
Heavy cream-butter mixture must be same temperature as chocolate when you combine them. Do not place hot cream into melted chocolate or you will burn it.
You should cool the mixture  to room temperature for an hour or so and stir it from time to time if you notice the fat separated on top.
