Cupcakes:
400g sugar
225g cups all purpose flour
75g unsweetened cocoa (best quality available)
1.5 teaspoons baking powder
1.5 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
240ml whole milk
120ml vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract (best quality available)
240ml boiling water
Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting:
113g unsalted butter (set at room temp about 10 minutes, but should still be cool)
225g cream cheese (directly from fridge)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (always use pure vanilla extract if possible)
450g powdered confectioners sugar
1 to 4 Tablespoons heavy cream, heavy whipping cream (or milk- although I do like the richness that cream adds)

Cupcakes:
Line muffin tin with paper liners.  Heat oven to 175 C.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla.  Beat on medium speed for one minute.
Stir in boiling water (the batter will be thin, don’t worry, this is right).
Fill liners 2/3 full with batter.  (I usually put the batter into a large measuring cup with a pour spout, and then pour the batter into the liners.)
Bake cupcakes for aproximately 18-22 minutes.
Cool completely on wire rack before frosting.
Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting:
Place butter in a large mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Add cream cheese and blend until fully combined and smooth, about 30 seconds.
Add vanilla extract and powdered sugar and blend on low speed until combined. Increase to medium speed and beat until it begins to get fluffy.
Slowly add the heavy cream, a little bit at a time until desired consistency is met. (Don’t add too much if you want the frosting to stay in place when piped on cupcakes.)
Beat until fluffy, about 1 minute.
Use at once or keep refrigerated. (This frosting will keep well in the refrigerator for several days, but you may need to re-beat it for the best texture.)
Note: I would use half of this or make twice as many cupcakes, because there is always some frosting left.
