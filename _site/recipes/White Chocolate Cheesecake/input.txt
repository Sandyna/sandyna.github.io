Base: 
350 g crushed shortbread biscuits
175 g melted butter
Filling: 
350 ml double cream
500 g cream
120 g icing sugar
250 g white chocolate, melted (originally Milkybar but fuck Nestlé)
Ganache: 
200 ml double cream
250 g white chocolate

Base:
Mix 350 grams of crushed shortbread biscuits with 175 grams of melted butter in a bowl until combined. 
Scoop the mixture into a tin, press it down firmly with the back of a spoon (I would use a cup) before placing it in the fridge to set.
Filling:
Whips 350ml of double cream until soft peaks have formed on the top, then sets the bowl aside. 
Mix 500 grams of cream cheese with 120 grams of icing sugar and whisk the two together, before adding 250 grams of melted white chocolate and whisking again until smooth. 
After scooping the whipped cream, set aside earlier into the cream cheese and chocolate mixture, pour the lot over the refrigerated biscuit base, smoothing it out and leaving it to chill for roughly five hours. 
Ganache: 
Pour hot double cream over the white chocolate. Use crumbs for decoration.
