6 egg yolks
100 g white sugar (150g orig, american recipe)
150 ml milk
~300 ml heavy cream (or 500)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
450 g mascarpone cheese
strong brewed coffee, room temperature (~5x kompresso coffee, ~160-200ml)
2 tablespoons rum/amaretto
3 packages ladyfinger cookies
unsweetened cocoa powder

In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour.
In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth. In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.
Arrange half of soaked ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish. Spread half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half of whipped cream over that. Repeat layers and sprinkle with cocoa. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours, until set.
