internet, modified by me

100 g butter
50 g sugar
50 g brown sugar
1 pcs egg
1 tsp vanilla
195 g flour
5 g starch
1 pinch salt
½ tsp baking powder
a bunch chocolate chips

Foam softened/half-melted butter with sugars. Beat in egg + vanilla + whatever liquid flavouring you have. Stir in (flour + salt + baking powder + starch + whatever powdery flavouring you have). Stir in chocolate chips + whatever else you want. Form cookies on a tray. 180 C, 10-12 min.

Here's some cookie ideas: mint and chocolate chips. Strawberry and white chocolate chips. Grind dried lavender with sugar in a pestle, sift and replace part of the sugar for lavender cookies. Orange peel, cardamom, spices, dark chocolate chips. Rainbow sprinkles. Go crazy. We all know you need it. You wouldn't be here, baking cookies at 3am otherwise.
