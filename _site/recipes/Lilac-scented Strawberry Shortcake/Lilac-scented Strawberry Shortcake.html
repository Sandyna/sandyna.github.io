	<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<h3 id="for-the-biscuit">FOR THE BISCUIT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 Cups All-purpose Flour</li>
  <li>¼ cup Raw Cane Sugar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons Baking Powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Fine Sea Salt</li>
  <li>1 cup (2 sticks) Cold Unsalted Butter, cubed</li>
  <li>1⅓ cup Heavy Cream or Half and Half</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="to-garnish">TO GARNISH</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 quart Heavy Whipping Cream, whipped to stiff peaks(sweeten, if desired)</li>
  <li>1 pound Fresh Strawberries, sliced horizontally</li>
  <li>Lilac Syrup (recipe is one post back)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.<br />
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat mats.<br />
Place flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor and pulse a few times to mix.<br />
With the processor running, Drop in the cubed butter piece by piece and process until just combined and forming small crumbs.<br />
Drizzle the cream into processor through top while processor is running and process until dough JUST comes together. Be careful to not over-process. Divide the dough into two equal portions.<br />
Place each dough portion down on a floured work surface into a circle that is roughly 6 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.<br />
Place each dough round onto a prepared baking sheet. Bake shortcakes for about 15-20 minutes or until tops are just turning slightly brown. Cool on a wire rack.<br />
Place the strawberries in a bowl and pour enough lilac syrup over them to coat each berry well. Place in the fridge while the shortcakes cool.<br />
TO ASSEMBLE:<br />
Carefully slice both biscuits in half, horizontally. Place one biscuit on a serving platter and spread or pipe ¼ of the whipped cream on top of it. Place a layer of strawberries over the cream. Repeat this process with the remaining biscuit rounds, cream, and berries.<br />
Decorate the top of the cake with strawberries, lilac blossoms, and drizzle the extra syrup over the top, as desired. Serve slices of cake with a spoonful of any remaining syrup.<br />
