## Ingredients

### FOR THE CRUST
* 1⅓ cup Coconut Flour
* ½ teaspoon Sea Salt
* ⅓ cup Maple Syrup
* ⅔ cup Coconut Oil (in a solid state)

### FOR THE FILLING
* 1 cup Cashews, soaked overnight
* 1 Can Full Fat Coconut Milk, water separated from the cream
* ¼ cup Water
* ¼ cup Meyer Lemon Juice
* ¼ teaspoon Sea Salt
* ⅓ cup Coconut Oil, liquefied
* ⅓ cup Coconut Butter, liquefied
* 2 tablespoons Cacao Butter, liquefied
* ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon Honey or Agave Syrup (if vegan)
* Seeds scraped from 1 Vanilla Bean
* Zest of 2 Meyer Lemons

### TO GARNISH
* 9-10 Oranges in varying shades, segmented (I used blood oranges, Cara Cara,, and standard oranges)
* Honey or Agave Syrup (for Vegan), as needed

## Instructions
FOR THE CRUST:<br/>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.<br/>
Place the coconut flour and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk together. Add the maple syrup and stir in until the mixture becomes crumbly. Add the coconut oil to the mixture and work into the flour with a spoon or rubber spatula until the a dough forms and there are no pieces of coconut oil remaining.<br/>
Press the dough into a 9" tart pan with a removable bottom. This may take some time - be patient and use the tips of your fingers to press the dough across the pan and up the sides.<br/>
Bake the tart shell in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden brown across the bottom.<br/>
Remove tart and let cool completely.<br/>
FOR THE FILLING:<br/>
Drain the cashews and place them in a high speed blender. Add the coconut water (set cream aside), water, meyer lemon juice, salt, coconut oil, coconut butter, cacao butter, and the honey. Blend, slowly working your way up to high speed, until the mixture is creamy and completely smooth.<br/>
Remove the lid and add the vanilla bean seeds, lemon zest, and coconut cream to the mixture. Replace lid and blend again at medium speed just until the coconut cream has been fully mixed in. Pour the mixture into the cool tart shell. Place in the refrigerator to set overnight. For a faster method, place in the freezer for 1 hour, or until fully set.<br/>
TO GARNISH:<br/>
Do not garnish the tart until an hour or two before serving - letting it sit with the orange slices for longer than 5-6 hours will cause the juices to run and the tart to become soggy.<br/>
Arrange the segmented oranges across the tart as pictured, or in whatever pattern you prefer.<br/>
Brush the tops of the orange slices with honey or agave until the tart is fully coated and glossy.<br/>
Remove tart from form and Serve!<br/>
