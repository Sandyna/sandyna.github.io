## Ingredients
* 40g buttery baking spread (recipe is based on 70% fat buttery baking spread)
* 170g condensed Milk
* 3 large eggs, beaten
* 1tsp vanilla extract
* 1tbsp Nescafé Espresso coffee powder, dissolved in 1tbsp boiling water
* 175g dark chocolate, melted
* 65g plain or Italian 00 flour
* Cocoa powder, to dust

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C, (180°C for fan ovens), Gas Mark 6. Place a large baking sheet into the oven. Grease the pudding basins, line the bases with a small circle of baking paper and dust each with cocoa powder.<br/>
2. Whisk the buttery baking spread and condensed milk together until pale and creamy (use an electric hand whisk if you have one). Gently whisk in the eggs, a little at a time, followed by the vanilla and coffee mixture. Add the melted chocolate and mix thoroughly, then add the flour and whisk until smooth.<br/>
3. Divide mixture evenly between the pudding basins and bake in the oven for 10 minutes on the hot tray.<br/>
