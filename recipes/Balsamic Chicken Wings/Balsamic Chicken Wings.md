## Ingredients
* 1 pound chicken wings
* 2 cloves garlic minced finely
* 2 Tbsp. Gluten Free soy sauce or Tamari or coconut aminos
* ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger

## Instructions
In a bowl mix together vinegar, garlic, ginger, honey and gluten free soy sauce. Rinse and dry chicken wings, place in a plastic zip bag.  Pour sauce over wings making sure to coat them all over and seal the bag place and in the refrigerator for at least one hour. I prefer 4 hours for more flavor.<br/>
Remove the chicken wings from the bag and place on a foil lined cookie sheet. Bake 375˚ for 30 minutes.<br/>
Serving Suggestions: For variety add 1 teaspoon red chili flakes for heat. Brush marinade over wings after 15 minutes of cooking for a more intense flavor.<br/>
