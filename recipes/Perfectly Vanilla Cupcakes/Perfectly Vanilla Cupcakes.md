* 200g sugar

## Instructions
Line muffin tin with paper liners.  Heat oven to 175 C.<br/>
In a medium bowl, add cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir together with whisk, and set aside.<br/>
In the bowl of an electric mixer, add eggs and beat 10-20 seconds. Add sugar and continue to beat on medium speed about 30 seconds. Add vanilla and oil, beat.<br/>
Reduce mixer speed to low and slowly add about half of the flour mixture. Add the milk, then the rest of the flour and the sour cream. Beat until just combined, scrap down the side of the bowl.<br/>
