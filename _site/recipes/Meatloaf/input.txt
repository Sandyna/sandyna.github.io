1 tbsp oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
450g spinach leaves
60ml ketchup
2 tbsp soft brown sugar
1 tsp vinegar
300g minced beef
300g minced pork
60g fresh-ish breadcrumbs
2 eggs
60ml plain yoghurt or milk
1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
3 tsp Dijon mustard
3 tsp Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp salt, or to taste
Black pepper
10 rashers of streaky smoked bacon

Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the onion. Fry for about five minutes until softened, then add the garlic. Cook, stirring regularly, for another couple of minutes, then set aside.
Heat the oven to 180C and line a rimmed baking dish with foil. Wash the spinach well, then put in a large, lidded pan over a medium heat, cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally until it has wilted – this should only take a couple of minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water and squeeze out as thoroughly as you can. Roughly chop. Mix together the ketchup, sugar and vinegar in a bowl.
Put the minced meats in a large mixing bowl with the breadcrumbs, spinach and onion, but don’t wash the onion pan yet. Whisk together the eggs, yoghurt or milk and seasonings, plus a generous amount of pepper, then combine with the meat using a fork or your hands. Put the onion pan on the heat, grease lightly, and fry a little of the mixture to check the seasoning, adjusting if necessary.
Lift the mixture on to your baking sheet and shape into a loaf (wet hands are the best tool for this). Brush with the ketchup glaze, then bake for 30 minutes.
Remove from the oven and arrange the bacon rashers over the top, overlapping, tucking the edges underneath the loaf. Bake for around another 30 minutes (the internal temperature should reach 70C), then allow to cool for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.
