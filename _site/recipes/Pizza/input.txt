650g 00 flour (or strong white flour)
7g sachet easy-blend yeast
2 tsp salt
25ml olive oil
50ml warm milk
325ml warm water
pizza toppings

Make the dough: 
mix the flour, yeast and salt together in a large mixing bowl and stir in the olive oil and milk. Gradually add the water, mixing well to form a soft dough.
Turn the dough out on to a floured work surface and knead for about five minutes, until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for about 1½ hours, until doubled in size.
When the dough has risen, knock it back, then knead again until smooth, roll into a ball and set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour until risen again.
Prepare the pizzas:
Preheat the oven to its highest setting.
Divide the dough into six balls and roll each out onto a lightly floured work surface until 20cm in diameter. (You can also make one big pizza.)
Spread a little passata (or homemade tomato sauce) over each pizza base and top with your favourite toppings.
Bake the pizzas in the oven for 10-12 minutes until the bases are crisp and golden-brown around the edges and any cheese on the topping has melted.
