## Ingredients
* 2 cups sushi rice
* Water (according to instructions on rice)
* 3 tbsp rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1.5 tsp salt

## Instructions
Cook rice according to instructions on the packaging. If nothing is specified there, use a bit more than 2 cups water per cup of rice. Rinse rice, put together with water.<br/>
Cook covered on highest for ~5m, until the rice boils. Reduce heat and boil for 15 more minutes (for a total of 20m). Don't stir, ever. After that, leave covered for 5-10 more minutes.<br/>
Prepare rice seasoning: Put vinegar, sugar and salt with a bit of water, heat up and dissolve everything.<br/>
Scoop out rice into a bowl, add rice seasoning and mix well. Add seasoning gradually, not to overdo it. Leave somewhere to cool.<br/>
