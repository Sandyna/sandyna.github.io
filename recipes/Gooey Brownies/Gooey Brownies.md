## Ingredients
* 125g butter, plus extra for greasing
* 125g good dark chocolate
* 3 large eggs
* 300g soft light brown sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 150g flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 25g cocoa powder
* 125g pecans or walnuts, toasted and roughly chopped

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/350ºF/gas mark 4.<br/>
Put the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt on low in a microwave, checking it every couple of minutes. (Alternatively, put it over a pan of simmering water, making sure the base doesn’t touch the water, and allow it to melt slowly.)<br/>
Stir the two ingredients together, then set aside to cool a little. Grease and line a 16 x 26cm/6¼ x 10½in baking tin with baking parchment.<br/>
Whisk the eggs, sugar and vanilla extract in a bowl until thick and moussey. When you lift the whisk out of the bowl, it should leave a ribbon-like trail.<br/>
Sift the flour and cocoa over the mousse mixture, then pour the chocolate mixture carefully around it. Add the nuts.<br/>
Use a large metal spoon to fold everything together. You can be gentle at first, so as not to knock out too much air, but towards the end use firm, fast strokes.<br/>
Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 20 minutes.<br/>
Cool in the tin. Lift out and cut into squares. Clever cooking<br/>
It’s crucial not to overbake these – the gooeyness is the whole point. You need to have the confidence to remove them from the oven almost before you think they’re ready.<br/>
To freeze:<br/>
To freeze, keep the brownie in any baking parchment that you’ve cooked it in. Wrap the whole thing in clingfilm (plastic wrap)and freeze for up to one month. To thaw, take the packet out of the freezer and unwrap half an hour before you want to eat them.<br/>
