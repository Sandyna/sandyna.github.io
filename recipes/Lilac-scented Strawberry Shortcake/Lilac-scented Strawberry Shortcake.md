## Ingredients

### FOR THE BISCUIT
* 4 Cups All-purpose Flour
* ¼ cup Raw Cane Sugar
* 2 tablespoons Baking Powder
* 1 teaspoon Fine Sea Salt
* 1 cup (2 sticks) Cold Unsalted Butter, cubed
* 1⅓ cup Heavy Cream or Half and Half

### TO GARNISH
* 1 quart Heavy Whipping Cream, whipped to stiff peaks(sweeten, if desired)
* 1 pound Fresh Strawberries, sliced horizontally
* Lilac Syrup (recipe is one post back)

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.<br/>
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpat mats.<br/>
Place flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor and pulse a few times to mix.<br/>
With the processor running, Drop in the cubed butter piece by piece and process until just combined and forming small crumbs.<br/>
Drizzle the cream into processor through top while processor is running and process until dough JUST comes together. Be careful to not over-process. Divide the dough into two equal portions.<br/>
Place each dough portion down on a floured work surface into a circle that is roughly 6 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.<br/>
Place each dough round onto a prepared baking sheet. Bake shortcakes for about 15-20 minutes or until tops are just turning slightly brown. Cool on a wire rack.<br/>
Place the strawberries in a bowl and pour enough lilac syrup over them to coat each berry well. Place in the fridge while the shortcakes cool.<br/>
TO ASSEMBLE:<br/>
Carefully slice both biscuits in half, horizontally. Place one biscuit on a serving platter and spread or pipe ¼ of the whipped cream on top of it. Place a layer of strawberries over the cream. Repeat this process with the remaining biscuit rounds, cream, and berries.<br/>
Decorate the top of the cake with strawberries, lilac blossoms, and drizzle the extra syrup over the top, as desired. Serve slices of cake with a spoonful of any remaining syrup.<br/>
