## Ingredients
* 2 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon filets
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 4 cups ice water
* 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 cup creme fraiche, sour cream, or full-fat Greek yogurt
* 1/4 cup loosely packed chopped fresh dill, chives, or tarragon
* Zest and juice of 1 lemon
* 1 English cucumber, sliced in 1/4-inch rounds
* 1/4 red onion, thinly sliced
* 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar

## Instructions
Set the Anova Sous Vide Precision Cooker to 125ºF (52ºC) for medium-rare or 135ºF (57ºC) for medium.<br/>
For the brine, whisk 1/4 cup kosher salt into the ice water until dissolved. Add the salmon and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to one hour.<br/>
Remove the salmon fillets from the brine and rinse with cold water. Pat dry and place each filet in a separate zipper lock or vacuum seal bag with 2 tablespoons of olive oil.<br/>
Seal the bags using the water immersion technique or a vacuum sealer on the moist setting. Place in the water bath and set the timer for 20 minutes, or up to 50 minutes.<br/>
Meanwhile, prepare the lemon-dill creme fraiche: In a medium bowl, stir together the creme fraiche, dill, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br/>
Prepare the cucumber salad: In a second medium bowl, combine the cucumber, red onion, red wine vinegar, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br/>
Finishing steps:<br/>
When the timer goes off, remove the bags from the water bath. Carefully remove the salmon and pat very dry with paper towels.<br/>
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the salmon skin-side down and sear until skin is crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Serve with lemon-dill creme fraiche and cucumber salad.<br/>
