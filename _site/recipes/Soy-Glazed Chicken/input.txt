1 1/2 lbs 4 chicken thighs
2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon five-spice powder
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine or Japanese cooking sake
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 heaping tablespoons sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons oil
2 cloves garlic minced
White sesame
Chopped scallion

Debone the chicken thighs following the instructions here. Mix the soy sauce, five spice powder, wine, sesame oil and sugar together. Whisk to dissolve sugar completely. Add the sauce mixture to the chicken. Stir to coat well.
Heat up a skillet on low to medium heat and add the oil. When the oil is heated, add the garlic and saute until they turn light brown. Add the chicken and all the sauce into the skillet and cook slowly, for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce reduces.
Remove the chicken from the skillet, garnish with white sesame and scallion, serve hot with steamed rice.
