145g cake flour (yes, it should be cake flour - white and finely milled)
3g baking powder
2g teaspoon baking soda
3g teaspoon salt
2 eggs
200g sugar
1.5 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
120 ml (114g) oil (vegetable, canola or extra light olive oil)
80 ml (82g) milk (whole or low fat, but avoid fat free)
80g sour cream (full fat or light, but avoid fat free)

Line muffin tin with paper liners.  Heat oven to 175 C.
In a medium bowl, add cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir together with whisk, and set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, add eggs and beat 10-20 seconds. Add sugar and continue to beat on medium speed about 30 seconds. Add vanilla and oil, beat.
Reduce mixer speed to low and slowly add about half of the flour mixture. Add the milk, then the rest of the flour and the sour cream. Beat until just combined, scrap down the side of the bowl.
The batter will be thin. Pour batter into a muffin pan prepared with paper liners. Fill liners about 2/3 full.
Bake cupcakes in pre-heated oven for 12-14 minutes.
