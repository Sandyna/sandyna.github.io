## Ingredients
* 1/3 cup melted butter
* 1 cup white sugar
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons grated lemon zest
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1/4 cup white sugar

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x4 inch loaf pan.<br/>
In a mixing bowl, beat together butter, 1 cup sugar, juice and eggs. Combine flour, baking powder and salt; stir into egg mixture alternately with milk. Fold in lemon zest, nuts, and blueberries. Pour batter into prepared pan.<br/>
Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool bread in pan for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, combine lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar in a small bowl. Remove bread from pan and drizzle with glaze. Cool on a wire rack.<br/>
