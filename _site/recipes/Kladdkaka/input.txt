200g Caster Sugar
140g Plain Flour
50g Cocoa Powder
2tsps Baking Powder
2tsps Vanilla Sugar
120g Butter
2 eggs

Start off by preheating your oven to 175 degrees Celsius. Blend the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and vanilla sugar in a bowl. Melt the butter in a pan or the microwave and pour in. Mix well and finally crack in the eggs and beat together to form a thick batter.
Grease a round 20cm tin (a pie form?). If the tin has a tendency to stick, consider lining the bottom with greaseproof paper as well. Spoon the batter into the tin and smooth out to the edges.
Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes before removing and allowing to cool for ~10 minutes before carefully removing from the tin. Try not to over-bake the cake. If you do the gooey consistency of the cake may be lost.
Enjoy with some raspberries and whipped cream, or just on its own, for a soft, chocolatey treat.
